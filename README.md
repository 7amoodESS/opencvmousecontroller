# opencvmousecontroller

This is a basic prototype for making sixth sense. This code would allow you to access your mouse with hands using your laptops's camera. For further extensions we will integrate it with sound and speakers for making it accessible for blind people.
 
 #### Purpose:- Accessing your laptop using your camera. Basically it is for blind people who cant operate computers.
 
 #### Requirements:-
 1. Numpy
 2. Pyautogui
 3. OpenCV
 
 #  # Steps to access or use it:-
 
 1. Use your right hand's index finger and middle finger while keeping all other fingers closed. Then for menu you just open you hands.
 2. Just use you hands to navigate to the folder you want to access or move to.
